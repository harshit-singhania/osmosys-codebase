there are several differences between type casting and type conversion, including:
type casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another done by the programmer while type conversion 
is the process of converting a variable from one type to another. Type casting can happen at both compile time and run time, 
depending on the type of casting being performed. While type conversion can only happen at run time. 

type casting is done generally for the primitive data types, while type conversion can be done for both primitive and non-primitive data types.

it is possible to do type casting in a user defined data type
