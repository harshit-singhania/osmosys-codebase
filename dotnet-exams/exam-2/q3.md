1. Declare the Delegate: Use the delegate keyword to define a delegate type, ensuring its signature matches the method it will reference.
2. Instantiate the Delegate: Create an instance of the delegate and assign it to a method 
    with the same signature.
3. Invoke the Delegate: Call the delegate like a regular 
    method to execute the assigned function(s).

Delegates are especially useful in scenarios like event handling, where maintaining flexibility is crucial. Instead of tightly linking components together, delegates allow different parts of the application to communicate without direct dependencies.
